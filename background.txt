Within the same chromosome that a gene lies, non-coding DNA called Cis-regulatory elements (CREs) which bind transcriptions factors (TFs) exist. CREs differ from coding genomic DNA because it is not translated into proteins from RNA transcripts. Promoters and enhancers are two types of CREs, often found near transcription start sites(TSSs), which provide sites for TFs to bind to and which regulate the spatial and temporal expression patterns of coding genes. One common promoter in eukaryotic genes is the TATA-box sequence, on which highly conserved transcriptional regulators sit. Enhancers are a core component of the regulatory system of gene expression, since different enhancers give rise to a limited range of tissues. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the CREs of a gene in order to understand its regulatory network. There exist similar patterns in promoter DNA sequences known as motifs which provide specific binding sites for TFs. Other motifs may also lie in the conserved non-coding region far away from the gene, controlling a unique subset of gene's expression. *insert why it is difficult to find promoter motifs* Therefore, in some organisms it is challenging to identify these motifs throughout the entire genome. In recent years, techniques like CAGE and RAMPAGE have provided insight into the TSS profiles of various genomes. Combining the TSS profiles with a statistical model based on machine learning algorithms, we are able to establish recurring motifs found in the promoter regions. However, identifying motifs is still challenging in higher organisms, and often redundant motifs which are biologically irrelevant are revealed through the process. Our work therefore, aimed to devise a simple work flow by combining statistical methods to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of motif finding.
