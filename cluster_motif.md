\hspace*{2em}Sequence motifs representing transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) are commonly encoded as position frequency matrices (PFM) or degenerate consensus sequences (CS). These formats are used to represent TFBS profiles in transcription factor databases, as well as motifs predicted using computational methods. Efficient post-processing after computational identification of motifs is needed to reduce the redundancy of the motifs predicted. Some clustering approaches are also used to find motifs conserved by evolution and co-regulated genes\cite{Jensen15102005}.
