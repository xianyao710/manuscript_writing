The promoter of a gene is centrally important in determining if and when transcription will be initiated. The nucleotide sequence of the promoter specifies the recruitment of DNA-binding proteins, including the transcription factors (TFs) that regulate gene expression. The short DNA sequence motifs that specify protein binding are therefore the essential functional components of the promoter. Comparison of known TF binding sites can detect the presence of protein-recognition elements in a given promoter, but only when the binding site of the relevant DNA-binding protein is already known. Because this knowledge is currently limited to small subset of TFs, much effort has been devoted to discovery of regulatory motifs by comparative analysis of the DNA sequence of promoters. By finding conserved regions between multiple promoters, motifs may be identified without prior knowledge of TF binding sites.
