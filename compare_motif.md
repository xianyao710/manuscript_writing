\hspace*{2em}Two basic tasks exist when investigating the TFs binding sites genome-wide:one is to identify conserved known motifs, the other is to discover new motifs. Numerous databases such as TRANSFAC, JASPAR, SCPD that have known motifs are available for motif comparison \cite{pmid16808896}\cite{Sandelin01012004}\cite{Zhu01071999}. It is important to compare predicted motifs with known motif databases for finding the core promoters with biological significance. There are quite a few methods to quantify the similarities between pairs of motifs such as calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient and alternate motif column comparison function. Here, we choose Tomtom software which implements an algorithm to model the empirical null distribution of scores from an arbitrary, additive column comparison function\cite{Gupta2007}.

\hspace*{2em}Tomtom is developed as a statistical method for comparing two DNA or protein motifs with one another. The program consider all possible relative offsets between two motifs and consider reverse complement matches as well. By using a dynamic programming algorithm, Tomtom estimates the null distribution of the sum of scores for any range of contiguous columns in the query motifs. This makes it possible for users to determine whether the motif comparison score between the query motif and a particular target motif is statistically significant\cite{Gupta2007}.
