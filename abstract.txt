To understand the regulation network of genes is one of the most important, but not well understood type of information hidden in genomic DNA. The nucleotide sequence patterns, also known as motifs are short recurring fragments of DNA that play important roles in regulation of gene expressions. They often indicate conserved sequence specific binding sites for proteins such as transcription factors, RNA polymerase etc. By identifying motifs in our genome sequences, we can better know gene expression pattern and also have better annotation of genome. Combining experimental methods like CAGE, RAMPAGE, ChIP-Seq together with programs like MEME suite or HOMER, we are able to predict motifs in the region of interest with given genomic sequences. Cluster-Buster and other tools proposed ways to discover dense cluster of motifs that may diagnose regulatory regions more accurately.However, a statistic validation of prediction  has not yet been introduced. Random motifs without biological meaning and redundant motifs that need to be merged are quite common to be observed during motif prediction. Here, we present a 10-fold cross-validation statistic method to cluster and merge predicted motifs so that reliable motifs with biological significance can be produced for further gene expression investigation.
